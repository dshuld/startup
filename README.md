## Conflict Resolution
From this assignment, I learned that I can selectively manage the resolution between two differing commits to the same branch instead of needing to pick one over the other. I think that it is a very helpful feature of Github.
## Elevator Pitch
Pixel Pals is a digital companion game where you can customize your own virtual pet, and explore different places with it. The game allows players to customize their own virtual pet, and explore different places in a virtual world. The game's minimalist pixelated style is reminiscent of the classic Tamagotchi pets, but with a modern twist. Players can earn points through their pet's actions and use them to unlock new items and places for their pet. This allows for a sense of progression and achievement as players navigate the virtual world with their pet. Additionally, players can add friends and check in on their progress, and even message them. This adds a social element to the game, allowing players to compete and interact with their friends. Overall, Pixel Pals offers a unique and exciting experience that combines the nostalgia of virtual pets with the freedom and exploration of a virtual world.
